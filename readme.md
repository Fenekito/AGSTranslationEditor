# Java AGS Translation Editor

**This is a simple editor for AGS (Adventure Game Studio) Translation Files. It allows you to create and modify .trs Files to your heart's content**

The program is built on Java since that's the language I'm most comfortable with and because of that, it's a requirement to have it to run it.

For windows there is a standalone release that doesn't require Java, and maybe in the future there will also be a standalone Linux and Mac version.

## About the program

The program was initially made to make modding languages easier for me so the workflow reflects that.
I'm open to improving it to work better for others as long as I'm able to get proper feedback on feaures and quality of life features.

To use the program just open the Jar file (or the executable if you downloaded the windows executable)
It should display the following interface

From here you can choose to open an existing file or start adding text from scratch.

After finishing your work, you can press the save button to save all your work.
The program will also automatically save you progress in the background every minute as a backup.
The autosave file can be located in the same place as the program is located.
